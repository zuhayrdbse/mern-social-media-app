## Frontend

More specifically for the frontend I have implemented ReactJS as the frontend framework, React Router for navigation, Formik and yup for form and form validation, Redux Toolkit for state management, Redux with persistent for local storage and React dropzone for image and file upload.

I have used NodeJS as a run time, ExpressJS as a backend framework, Mongoose for managing MongoDB, Json Web Token for authentication and multer for file upload.
